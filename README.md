# 😊 Simple Face Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains a basic real-time face and eye detection system using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers. It is designed to demonstrate the fundamentals of computer vision for detecting facial features using Python.

---

## 📌 Features

- 👤 Real-time face detection with Haar Cascade
- 👁️ Eye detection within detected faces
- 📷 Works with webcam or video file input
- 📦 Easy to set up with minimal dependencies
- 🔁 Runs continuously until ESC is pressed

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) (`opencv-python`)

Install with pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### ▶️ Run with webcam:

```bash
python facedetect.py
```

### 🎥 Run with a video file:

```bash
python facedetect.py path/to/video.mp4
```

### 🧪 Use custom Haar Cascade XML:

```bash
python facedetect.py --cascade="path/to/face.xml" --nested-cascade="path/to/eye.xml"
```

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Model Initialization**:
   - Loads Haar Cascade XML files for face and eye detection.

2. **Frame Processing**:
   - Grayscale conversion and histogram equalization.
   - Face detection is performed on the entire frame.
   - Eye detection is performed within each detected face.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Draws green rectangles around detected faces.
   - Draws blue rectangles around detected eyes.
   - Display updates in real-time.

4. **Exit Mechanism**:
   - Press `ESC` to stop the program.

## 📂 About `__pycache__` and `.pyc` Files

The `__pycache__/` folder is automatically generated by Python to store compiled versions (`.pyc`) of Python files.

- `libcommon.cpython-38.pyc`: compiled version of `libcommon.py`
- `libvid.cpython-38.pyc`: compiled version of `libvid.py`
- `librender.cpython-38.pyc`: compiled version of `librender.py`

These files improve loading speed but **should not be manually edited** or included in version control.

### ✅ Recommendation

Add the following to `.gitignore`:

```
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```
